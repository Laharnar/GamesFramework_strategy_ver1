Units/NAVIGATION SPACE
- added 11.5.2018
Allows units to navigate in space around large moving objects, like carriers.
Nav space should be modifiable to fit certain behaviours.
It should work realtime.

A. Influence space
It's like fact, unless random decisions(enter or leave field) are assigned to singular moves.
Can be used for group flying, like ants. Nope can't those are random.
Can be used as state space.
Relies on unit in area response.
Actions are assigned probabilites, or "best direction".
Could use local nav space

B. Local avoidance
Problem with pathing around things, but could work well, since we don't have complex obstacles.
Relies on zone to zone response.
High calculation? n^2

E. avoidance-influence space
Combined zone to area
Problem-> what to calc danger from
Collision detection like with zones.
Square influence space to determine strenght of behaviour.
Could also just be function for dist in zone.

F. Flocking behaviour
Great for fighters. DO IT.
Idk how it would work with enemies. Layers?
Flock away from enemies, while going to target? Should work.
Can add small reward areas around ship.


no C. Local 3d nav space
Highly accurate, but not smooth.
Also needs handmade setup.

no D. Local unit nav space
Every unit has general local navigational targets that it can turn to.
Could be combined into go left/right-up ai.
I did this once instead of directions, it was kinda mehh.
